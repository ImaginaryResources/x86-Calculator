# Where is this 8086.zip from?

I was really curious to find the sources of the files from this zip, https://www.mediafire.com/file/mm7cjztce9efj4w/8086.zip/file 
This zip file is mentioned in every website and video tutorial for setting up MASM using DosBox, but yet there's no mention of where
they are from or what they do. These files are collected from older operating systems, so for the most part, direct downloads for these files do not exist.

## Orgin of Files
*The following information is gathered from the links above*    

### Turbo Assembler (TASM)    
Runs on and produces code for 16 or 32-bit x86 MS-DOS, released in 1989    

### Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)    
The earliest versions of MASM dates back to 1981    
MS-DOS versions up to 4.x included Microsoft's LINK utility   

### EXE2BIN.EXE   
Included in MS/DOS versions 1 thru 3.1    

### DEBUG.EXE   
Part of DOS 1.00 and has been included in MS-DOS    
Originally named DEBUG.COM, the executable was renamed into DEBUG.EXE with DOS 5.0    

### EDIT.COM    
Version 1.0 appeared in MS-DOS 5.00   

### BIN2HEX.EXE
August 11, 1999   
Because this requires a 8.3 [naming convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename) and was released in 1999 we can assume this program was created with Windows 95 or 98
