# x86-Calculator
An attempt to make a calculator with custom Arithmetic Instructions such as xor, and, shifts, and rotations and using the Irvine Library to read and write to the console 

Bitwise operations will be created to add, subtract, multiply, and divide

I want to make as much as I can from scratch
